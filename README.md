# Picrew Downloader
A Chromium/Firefox extension that adds two buttons to Picrew image makers:
- A button to download the currently visible layers as an OpenRaster file.
- A button to download the entire image maker as an OpenRaster file (resulting files can be quite large)

Also includes a poor attempt at me documenting the innards of the image makers' variables.  
Was previously hosted on my blog. [Previous commit history](https://github.com/mincerafter42/mincerafter42.github.io/commits/main/assets/Picrew%20Downloader%20(Chromium%20or%20Firefox%20extension).zip)  
Somebody suggested I make it its own GitHub repository so here it is.
